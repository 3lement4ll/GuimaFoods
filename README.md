This isthe first roject i took by my self, it is a thing I've been thinking about for about 3 years and know that I'm learning webdev I thought it was a good idea to try and do something.
It is a website for the traditional restaurantes from my city, kinda like a tripadvisor just for my region.
Right know is only html and css and far from finished. Has a lot of flaws erros clutter and problems, but I intend to come backto it when I have more knowlagde in css and html and when i start to learn about databases api's etc.
If anyone sees this and has any tips for me please post a comment.
